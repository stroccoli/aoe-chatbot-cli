# Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition - Strategy Guide

## Build Orders and Openers

### Archer Archer Push (AA Push) - Arabia

**Timing**: 14:30 - 15:00 min (first attack)  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Best for**: Learning, map control

**Goal**: Establish early economic advantage with consistent archer production

```
0:00 - 4 villagers hunt
0:40 - Scout to find boar + 1 more villager on hunt
2:00 - 2 villagers on boar (if found)
3:00 - Lure boar near Town Center
4:00 - Build mill, assign 3 villagers to berries
6:00 - Start wood with 4 villagers  
8:00 - Start sheep herding
8:30 - Mill up (500 food total)
10:00 - Build barracks while researching tools
11:00 - Build archery range
12:00 - First batch of archers (6-8)
14:00 - Attack enemy villagers with archers
```

**Tips**:
- Don't build houses early (you won't hit pop cap)
- Keep researching tool upgrades
- Build second TC around 12 min if safe

### Scouts into Knights - Arabia

**Timing**: 15:30 - 16:00 min (castle time)  
**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Best for**: Cavalry-focused civs (Franks, Mongols)

**Goal**: Aggressive cavalry push once you hit Castle Age

```
0:00 - Standard food gathering
6:00 - 3 vills on berries, 3 on wood
8:00 - Scout at 7:00 (scout early)
8:30 - Feudal with ~20-22 vills on food
9:30 - Build stable + archery range in feudal
11:00 - 3-4 scouts harassing vills + some archers (mix)
11:30 - 800 food + 200 gold collected = Castle up
14:00 - First knights pop out
14:30 - Attack with 3-4 knights + archer support
```

**Tips**:
- Scouts are weak early - focus harassment, not kills
- Transition archers to castle age immediately
- Knights need 3-4 units minimum to be effective

### Fast Castle Drush - Arabia

**Timing**: 14:00 - 14:30 min (castle time)  
**Difficulty**: Hard  
**Best for**: Map control, pressure

**Goal**: Get to castle age quickly while threatening enemy

```
0:00 - Standard food opening
6:00 - Minimal vills on wood (only 2), most on food
7:00 - Send 1 villager as "scout" to enemy base
8:00 - Feudal up with 20-21 vills on food (fast!)
9:00 - Build military production (barracks + archery range)
10:00 - Create 6-8 militia, send to enemy base (drush)
11:00 - While enemy defends, transition 800 food
12:30 - All military vills back to economy
13:30 - 800 + 200 collected = Castle up
14:00 - Unique units or massed cavalry
```

**Tips**:
- The drush (early militia attack) is NOT for kills - it's for distraction
- Your real attack comes at 14:00 with castle age units
- Requires good micro management and timing

## Civilization-Specific Strategies

### Britons - Archer Composition

**Strength**: Archers are 20% faster production, +2 range  
**Unique Unit**: Longbowman (better than elite archers)

**Strategy**:
1. Go aggressive with archers in feudal (normal timing)
2. Transition to elite archers in castle age
3. Add siege support (mangonels)
4. In imperial: mass elite archers + ballistas
5. Attack with positional advantage (hills, forests)

**Weakness**: Vulnerable to cavalry charges - add pikemen if needed

**Counter Play**: Aggressive cavalry rushes; monks converting expensive archers

---

### Franks - Cavalry Domination

**Strength**: Cavalry +20% faster, Paladins available  
**Unique Unit**: Paladin (super knight with +5 HP)

**Strategy**:
1. Feudal: Scouts to harass and map control
2. Castle Age: Knights immediately
3. Form deathball of 15+ knights
4. Use mobility to hit vulnerable spots
5. Imperial: Add Paladins, maintain numbers

**Keys to Success**:
- Constant knight production
- Don't try to fight in open against massed archers
- Use hills and forests to your advantage
- Keep enemy divided

---

### Goths - Infantry Spam

**Strength**: Infantry -25% cost, Huskarl (strong unique)  
**Special**: Huskarl unit produces super fast

**Strategy**:
1. Early pressure with militia in feudal
2. Castle: Massed infantry + huskarls
3. Use infantry bodies to absorb damage
4. Support with siege (cheap siege workshop)
5. Imperial: Overwhelming numbers of units

**Economy Trick**:
- With cheap infantry, you can afford more military than other civs
- Invest heavily into production buildings (multiple barracks)
- Always have resources for next batch

---

### Chinese - Economic Advantage

**Strength**: Tech costs -15%, start with extra villager  
**Unique Unit**: Chu Ko Nu (fires 3 arrows)

**Strategy**:
1. Economy focused - get early market
2. Feudal: Balanced units, but good economy
3. Castle Age: Transition to Chu Ko Nu + siege
4. Imperial: Dominate with tech advantage + units

**Key**: Don't fight head-to-head. Use economic advantage to out-tech opponent.

## Game Plans by Map Type

### Arabia - Open Map

1. **Early Game**: Scout early, build forward barracks near resources
2. **Feudal**: Archers or scouts for pressure
3. **Castle**: Transition to strong units (civ-dependent)
4. **Imperial**: Large army, siege, multiple attack points

**Focus**: Control center gold, prevent opponent from booming

### Black Forest - Heavy Woods

1. **Early Game**: Careful wood placement - easier to be attacked
2. **Feudal**: Keep defense at home, soften enemy with ranged
3. **Castle**: Siege units (mangonels/scorpions) become important
4. **Imperial**: Balanced composition, mobile army

**Focus**: Path clear through forests, control TCs in forest gaps

### Nomad - No Starting TC

1. **Early Game**: First 3 villagers gather berries/hunt
2. **Feudal**: Build TC in a safe spot (not enemy vision)
3. **Castle**: Expand aggressively, multiple TCs
4. **Imperial**: Standard meta

**Focus**: Survive to castle age without TC - economic damage from no production

- **Examples**: Arbalest, Crossbowman, Heavy Cavalry Archer

### Siege vs. Everything

- **Beats**: Buildings (especially), massed units in choke points
- **Loses to**: Cavalry (mobile units escaping), skirmishers (counter), Mobile archers
- **Usage**: Border raids, fortress breaking, artillery
- **Examples**: Mangonel, Scorpion, Bombard Cannon

### Monks

## Advanced Economy Tips

### Idle Time Management

**Key Rule**: Your TC should NEVER idle  
- Queue villagers constantly until 120+ population
- Build another TC at 14min (castle age transition)
- Use "Idle Villager" hotkey to find stuck workers

**Impact**: Every idle villager = lost food/wood/gold

### Critical Upgrade Timings

| Upgrade | When | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|
| Feudal Tools | 8:00 | +10% gathering speed |
| Mill ↑→↑→↑ | Before 15 farms | Farm efficiency chain |
| Horse Collar | Before 30+ farms | +10% farm output |
| Blacksmith Armor +1 | 11:00 Feudal | Huge survival bump |
| Blacksmith Weapons +1 | 12:00 Feudal | +1 damage per unit |
| Double-Bit Axe | 9:00 Feudal | Wood gathering +40% |

### Trading for Gold

When losing gold income:
- Build market + trade route (4-6 carts)
- Sell food for gold in market
- Each cart nets ~0.5 gold/sec
- Costs 100 food to make trade route → convert extra food to gold

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Mistake**: Building only archers without counter-units  
✅ **Fix**: Add pikemen or cavalry for balance

❌ **Mistake**: Not scouting enemy position/civilization  
✅ **Fix**: Scout within first 3 minutes, identify civ by buildings

❌ **Mistake**: Abandoning economy for military  
✅ **Fix**: Keep 60+ villagers while making units

❌ **Mistake**: Fighting in open against composition that counters you  
✅ **Fix**: Use terrain, choke points, and hit-and-run tactics

❌ **Mistake**: Too aggressive early without economy to support  
✅ **Fix**: Economic pressure usually beats early aggression

❌ **Mistake**: Never upgrading military armor/weapons  
✅ **Fix**: Research all blacksmith upgrades for +1/+1

## Mental Game & Decision Making

### When to Attack

✅ **Good times to attack**:
- You have army + economic advantage
- Enemy clearly weak/distracted
- You can afford to lose some units and rebuild
- You see opening in their defense

❌ **Bad times**:
- Your economy is weaker
- You can't afford reinforcements
- Their army is stronger
- You haven't scouted their defenses

### When to Defend

✅ **Turtle Up** when:
- Significantly outnumbered
- Your economy is strong (can wait them out)
- You can reach critical mass (imperial age) where you dominate

### When to All-In

✅ **All-in/Desperation** when:
- You're already behind (nothing to lose)
- You see perfect opportunity
- You've read opponent's build incorrectly (attacking your weakness means their defense is weak)
