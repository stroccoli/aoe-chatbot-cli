# Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition - FAQ

## General Game Mechanics

### What is Age of Empires II?

Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition (AoE2 DE) is a remaster of the classic 1999 real-time strategy (RTS) game. 
You control a civilization through different ages, from the Dark Age to the Imperial Age, gathering resources, 
building structures, training units, and defeating opponents through military, economic, or wonder victory.

### What are the four main resources?

- **Food (Alimento)**: Used to train villagers and infantry units. Gathered from deer, boar, fish, berries, and farms
- **Wood (Madera)**: Used for buildings and basic structures. Gathered from trees
- **Gold (Oro)**: Used for advanced units and technologies. Gathered from gold ore deposits
- **Stone (Piedra)**: Used for walls, towers, and fortifications. Gathered from stone quarries

### How many villagers do I need?

The number depends on your strategy and game stage:
- **Early Game (0-10 min)**: 20-25 villagers total
- **Mid Game (10-30 min)**: 40-60 villagers
- **Late Game (30+ min)**: 80-120+ villagers

A common benchmark: aim for at least one villager per resource type you're gathering heavily.

### What are the four main Ages?

1. **Dark Age**: Starting age, basic economy only
2. **Feudal Age**: Requires 500 Food - access to military units, barracks
3. **Castle Age**: Requires 800 Food + 200 Gold - unique units, advanced buildings
4. **Imperial Age**: Requires 1000 Food + 300 Gold - all units and technologies available

## Economy and Resources

### How do I gather resources efficiently?

- **Food**: Gather from hunts first, then berries, then farms. Use mills to increase farm efficiency
- **Wood**: Build lumber camps near trees. Closer = faster gathering
- **Gold**: Build mining camps near deposits. Use pickaxe upgrades at the blacksmith
- **Stone**: Quarry gathering is slowest. Plan stone needs carefully

### What are farms and how do they work?

Farms are re-farmable food sources that villagers can work on after initial placement. 
Each farm produces about 100 food for one villager.

**Farm upgrades:**
- Horse Collar (Medieval Age): +10% farm efficiency
- Heavy Plow (Castle Age): +20% farm efficiency (total)
- Crop Rotation (Imperial Age): +33% farm efficiency (total)

### When should I build trading posts?

Trading posts enable market trading for gold. Build when:
- You've secured your territory
- You have enough resources to spare
- You want to convert extra resources to gold for military unit production

Trade routes generate approximately 0.5 gold/second per trader.

## Military Strategy

### What is a Feudal Rush?

A Feudal Rush (sometimes called "Drush" - Dark Rush) is an aggressive early attack during Feudal Age (minutes 8-12).
You sacrifice early economy to damage your opponent before they establish defenses.

**Typical Feudal Rush:**
- 6-8 militia or light cavalry
- Attack opponent's villagers and resource gatherers
- Destroy early mills or lumber camps
- Goal: Set opponent's economy back by 2+ minutes

**Risks**: If it fails, you fall significantly behind in economy and tech

### How do I defend against a rush?

- Build walls around your base perimeter
- Keep 4-6 military units near villagers
- Build a defensive tower near key resources
- Don't panic - focus on staying alive while maintaining income
- Transition to castle age quickly to get better units

### What's the ideal unit mix (army composition)?

The best mix depends on opponent civs and units, but generally:
- **40% Melee**: Knights, Swordsmen, Samurai
- **50% Ranged**: Archers, Skirmishers, Cavalry Archers
- **10% Utility**: Siege, Monks, Scouts

**General principle**: Never make only one unit type - your opponent will counter it

## Advanced Mechanics

### What is an "Elo" rating?

Elo (from chess) measures player skill. 
- 1000-1200: Beginner
- 1200-1400: Intermediate
- 1400-1600: Advanced
- 1600-1800: Expert
- 1800+: Competitive/Pro level

### What are "hotkeys" and why use them?

Hotkeys are keyboard shortcuts that let you execute commands quickly without using the mouse.
Examples:
- 'S' → Stable
- 'C' → Barracks/Castle
- 'A' → Archery Range
- 'M' → Market

Learning hotkeys improves your APM (Actions Per Minute), making you faster and more competitive.

### What is "Map Control"?

Controlling key locations on the map:
- Gold/stone deposits
- Relics (in certain game modes)
- Chokepoints
- High ground (in some maps)

Players with map control can deny resources to enemies and maintain economic advantage.

### How do I improve my economy?

1. **Efficient villager placement**: Don't leave villagers idle
2. **Research all economic upgrades** at appropriate times
3. **Build markets** for passive gold generation
4. **Use trade routes** effectively
5. **Plan resource needs** before you need them
6. **Never build units you can't afford** - it wastes resources

## Civilizations & Matchups

### Which civilization is best?

There is no "best" civilization in AoE2 DE. Each of the 43 civilizations has unique strengths:
- **Britons**: Strongest archers
- **Franks**: Strongest cavalry
- **Chinese**: Best economy, tech tree
- **Goths**: Strong infantry in mass
- **Aztecs**: Strong early game

Choose based on your playstyle: Economic, Military Aggressive, Defensive, etc.

### What are "bonuses" and "unique units"?

**Bonuses**: Civilization-specific benefits
- Example: Britons' archers are 20% faster

**Unique Units**: Units only that civilization can train
- Example: Britons have Longbowmen

Both combine to define a civ's playstyle.

## Game Modes

### What's the difference between Random Map and Arabian?

- **Random Map**: Procedurally generated maps with varied terrain
- **Arabia**: Preset balanced map with open spaces
- **Black Forest**: Heavily forested map (different strategy)
- **Nomad**: No starting Town Center (unique challenges)

Each map type requires different early game strategies.

### What's a "Treaty" game?

A treaty is an agreement between players not to attack until a certain time (usually 20-40 minutes). 
Used in Team Games to ensure everyone reaches a certain tech level before combat begins.

### What's a "Regicide" game mode?

In Regicide, each player has a "King" unit. If your King dies, you lose immediately. This creates a different strategic focus around protecting your leader rather than pure economic or military power.

## Performance & Tips

### How can I improve as a beginner?

1. Watch pro player streams/YouTube channels (Hera, TheViper, Jordan)
2. Play single-player campaigns to learn mechanics
3. Practice Build Orders on Random Maps
4. Focus on ONE civilization for 50+ games
5. Watch replays of your losses to see mistakes

### What are common beginner mistakes?

1. Building too many houses early
2. Forgetting to constantly produce villagers
3. Not researching upgrades
4. Building units then not moving them
5. Idle town center
6. Wasting resources on units you don't need
7. Not scouting the enemy

### How do I get better at managing multiple tasks?

**Multitasking tips:**
- Use hotkeys constantly
- Bind army groups to number keys (1-9)
- Keep camera focus on your production centers often
- Pause and assess periodically
- Practice with smaller armies first, then scale up

## Troubleshooting

### Game crashes or stutters

- Lower graphics settings
- Close background applications
- Update graphics drivers
- Verify game files through Steam
- Clear shader cache

### I keep losing early game

- Check your build order against your opponent's
- Watch pro games for better opening strategies
- Make sure your villager production never stops
- Keep more military units for defense
- Scout more often to predict rushes

### My economy falls behind mid-game

- You're likely building too many military units too early
- Make sure you have 60+ villagers before heavy military production
- Research all economy techs on time
- Don't leave villagers idle
- Build more resource gathering buildings when needed
